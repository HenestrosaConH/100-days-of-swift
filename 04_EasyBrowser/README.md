# EasyBrowser
Project 4 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://hackingwithswift/100/24

## I've learnt...

- loadView(). loadView() + viewDidLoad() = onCreate() in Android
- WKWebView
- Delegation of protocols
- URL and URLRequest classes
- UIToolbar
- UIProgressView
- Key-Value observing

## I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- If users try to visit a URL that isn’t allowed, show an alert saying it’s blocked.
- Try making two new toolbar items with the titles Back and Forward. You should make them use webView.goBack and webView.goForward.
- Try changing the initial view controller to a table view like in project 1, where users can choose their website from a list rather than just having the first in the array loaded up front.
