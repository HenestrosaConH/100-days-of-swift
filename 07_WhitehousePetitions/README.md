# WhitehousePetitions
Project 7 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://hackingwithswift/100/33

## I've learnt...

- Downloading JSON with Data class
- Codable & JSONDecoder
- UITabBarController. Same as BottomNavigationBar in Android
- SceneDelegate to add a tab bar controller item by code at the init of the app.

## I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- Add a Credits button to the top-right corner using UIBarButtonItem. When this is tapped, show an alert telling users the data comes from the We The People API of the Whitehouse.
- Let users filter the petitions they see. This involves creating a second array of filtered items that contains only petitions matching a string the user entered. Use a UIAlertController with a text field to let them enter that string. This is a tough one, so Iâ€™ve included some hints below if you get stuck.
