# NamesToFaces

Project 10 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/42

I've learnt...

- UICollectionView. Like the CardView in Android
- UIImagePickerController for picking images from the gallery
- UUID (Universal Unique IDentifier)
- NSObject subclasses
- fatalError()

I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- Add a second UIAlertController that gets shown when the user taps a picture, asking them whether they want to rename the person or delete them.
- Try using picker.sourceType = .camera when creating your image picker, which will tell it to create a new image by taking a photo. This is only available on devices (not on the simulator) so you might want to check the return value of UIImagePickerController.isSourceTypeAvailable() before trying to use it!

To do as a personal challenge...

Nothing for now
