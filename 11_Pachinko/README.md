Project 11 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/45

I've learnt...

- SpriteKit. iOS framework for games development
- Physics
- Blend modes
- CGFloat. Different from Float and Double. It has the ability to change size depending on what device it's running on.
- SKS files for animations

I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- The pictures we’re using in have other ball pictures rather than just “ballRed”. Try writing code to use a random ball color each time they tap the screen.
- Right now, users can tap anywhere to have a ball created there, which makes the game too easy. Try to force the Y value of new balls so they are near the top of the screen.
- Give players a limit of five balls, then remove obstacle boxes when they are hit. Can they clear all the pins with just five balls? You could make it so that landing on a green slot gets them an extra ball.

To do as a personal challenge...

- Nothing for now
