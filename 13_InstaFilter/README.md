# InstaFilter
Project 13 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/52

I've learnt...

- CoreImage filters
- UISlider
- Writing images to the iOS photo album

I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
- Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
- Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
- (Day 58) Make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.

To do as a personal challenge...

- To add more filters
- Change the label and the functionality of the value of the sliders depending on which parameters the filter can handle (brightness, rotation, intensity...)
