# WhackAPenguin

Project 14 from the 100 Days of Swift Course https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/55

I've learnt...

- SKCropNode
- SKTexture
- asyncAfter()
- New SKAction types

I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- Record your own voice saying "Game over!" and have it play when the game ends.
- When showing “Game Over” add an SKLabelNode showing their final score.
- Use SKEmitterNode to create a smoke-like effect when penguins are hit, and a separate mud-like effect when they go into or come out of a hole. (This challenge needs some rework because when some penguins hide, the mud particle appears below the hole)

To do as a personal challenge...

- To add a max score with UserDefaults
- Difficulties
- Retry button
