# CapitalCities
Project 16 from the 100 Days of Swift Course www.hackingwithswift/100/61

I've learnt...
- MKMapView
- MKAnnotation
- MKPinAnnotationView
- CLLocationCoordinate2D

I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- Try typecasting the return value from dequeueReusableAnnotationView() so that it's an MKPinAnnotationView. Once thatâ€™s done, change the pinTintColor property to your favorite UIColor.
- Add a UIAlertController that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a mapType property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, .satellite gives a satellite view of the terrain.
- Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.

To do as a personal challenge...

- Nothing for now
