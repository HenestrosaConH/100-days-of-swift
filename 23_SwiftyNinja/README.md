# SwiftyNinja
Project 23 from the 100 Days of Swift course https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/77

## I've learnt...
- SKShapeNode. Creates onscreen graphical elements from mathematical points, lines, and curves
- AVAudioPlayer
- Physics speed (physicsWorld.speed)
- CaseIterable protocol. Super useful for enums
- removeFirst()
- Action groups 

## I have added the following features suggested by the instructor...

- (Not done) Try removing the magic numbers in the createEnemy() method. Instead, define them as constant properties of your class, giving them useful names.
- Create a new, fast-moving type of enemy that awards the player bonus points if they hit it.
- Add a “Game over” sprite node to the game scene when the player loses all their lives.

## To do as a personal challenge...
- To add replay button
- To understand the constants
- To refactor the project
