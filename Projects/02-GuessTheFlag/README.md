[Project 2](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2/overview) from the [100 Days of Swift course](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) by [Hacking With Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).

## I've learnt...

- The differences between @2x (the points unit are multiply by 2 on retina screens) and @3x (the points unit are multiply by 3 on HD retina screens)
- Asset catalogs (drop the files into the Assets folder, just like that)
- Handling of `UIButton`
- `CALayer` manages the UIKit. It's the core animation type responsible for managing the way your view looks. It sits below all our UI views.
- `UIColor`: For example, we can't put UIColor.lightGray property directly into our border color property because it belongs to `CALayer`, which doesn't know where UI color is. That's why we convert it into a cgColor.
- Randomize in Swift
- `UIAlertController`: The same as `AlertDialog` in Android.
- `UIAction`: A button that we add to the `UIAlertController`. Same as positive/negative buttons in `AlertDialog`.

## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/2/6/wrap-up):

>- [x] Try showing the player's score in the navigation bar, alongside the flag to guess.
>- [x] Keep track of how many questions have been asked, and show one final alert after they have answered 10.
>- [x] When someone chooses the wrong flag, tell them their mistake in your alert.
>- [x] ([Day 22](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/3/3/wrap-up)) Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped. 
>- [x] ([Day 49](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/12/5/wrap-up)) Modify project 2 so that it saves the playerâ€™s highest score, and shows a special message if their new score beat the previous high score.
>- [ ] ([Day 58](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/15/5/wrap-up)) Go back to project 2 and make the flags scale down with a little bounce when pressed.
>- [x] ([Day 73](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/21/4/wrap-up)) And for an even harder challenge, update project 2 so that it reminds players to come back and play every day. This means scheduling a week of notifications ahead of time, each of which launch the app. When the app is finally launched, make sure you call removeAllPendingNotificationRequests() to clear any un-shown alerts, then make new alerts for future days.

## To do as a personal challenge...
- [ ] Add more flags
- [ ] Stylize the layout
- [ ] Add more features (such as a timer and an option to modify the score goal)
