## I've learnt...

- `CoreImage` filters
- `UISlider`
- Writing images to the iOS photo album

## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/13/5):

>- [x] Try making the Save button show an error if there was no image in the image view.
>- [x] Make the Change Filter button change its title to show the name of the currently selected filter.
>- [x] Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.
>- [x] ([Day 58](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/15/5/wrap-up)) Make the image view fade in when a new picture is chosen. To make this work, set the alpha to 0 first.

## To do as a personal challenge...

- [ ] To add more filters
- [ ] Change the label and the functionality of the value of the sliders depending on which parameters the filter can handle (brightness, rotation, intensity...)
