## I Have Learnt...

- `MKMapView`: Part of the MapKit framework that provides a map interface to display map data from various sources, such as Apple's map service, third-party map services, or custom maps.
- `MKAnnotation`: A protocol defined in the MapKit framework that defines the properties and methods required to represent an annotation on a map. An annotation is a marker that you can add to a `MKMapView` to provide information about a specific location on the map, such as a point of interest or a user's location.
- `MKPinAnnotationView`: A subclass of `MKAnnotationView`, which is a generic annotation view that can display any kind of annotation. `MKPinAnnotationView` is designed to look like a standard pin, with a circular head and a long stem. It comes in three colors: red, green, and purple.
- `CLLocationCoordinate2D`: A struct defined in the Core Location framework. It has two properties: `latitude` and `longitude`. 

## Challenges

Taken from [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/16/4):

>- [x] Try typecasting the return value from `dequeueReusableAnnotationView()` so that it's an `MKPinAnnotationView`. Once thatâ€™s done, change the `pinTintColor` property to your favorite `UIColor`.
>- [x] Add a `UIAlertController` that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a `mapType` property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, `.satellite` gives a satellite view of the terrain.
>- [x] Modify the callout button so that pressing it shows a new view controller with a web view, taking users to the Wikipedia entry for that city.
